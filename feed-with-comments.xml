    <!-- Below is the "channel" tag. It contains metadata describing the feed as a whole. The "channel" tag in RSS has traditionally been used to describe a podcast or blog. In the decentralized music world, the "channel" tag could be used to descripe an album, a band, a label, a playlist, or more. The most common use of channels thus far has been for publishing albums, and this template has been designed for that particular use case. -->
    <channel>
        <!-- The "title" tag will contain the name of your album. -->
        <title>My Demu Album</title>
        <!-- The "itunes:author" tag describes the author of the content in the feed. For a Demu release, we put the Album's artist here. -->

        <!-- This "description" tag can be updated to give listeners a brief description of the album. -->
        <description>This feed is an example template XML file for decentralized music (Demu) releases. It is designed for artists to replace this info with details from their own music project in order to make open-source, self-hosted v4v digital releases. This template is made available by the Wolf on a value-for-value basis for personal and commercial use. If you receive value from this template please consider raising the wolf's value split share, which is defaulted to "1" in the podcast:value tags below. As a v4v resource, it is acceptable to remove and customize the value splits for your own testing or trial purposes. However, if you do receive value from using this template and choose not to return that value, you run the risk of being exposed as a douchebag!</description>

If you are publishing a playlist of other existing songs (or any other "list mediums"), you should add a capital "L" to the end of the medium tag's content.

Person tag attributes are "href" which is a link to some landing page for that person (maybe a personal website or social profile), "img" which is a link to an online profile picture, "group" and "role" describe the person's role in the project. You can list person tags in the channel level or the item level. If present in the item level, person tags will overwrite all channel-level persons, so channel level persons who are involved in specific items should be included in both.

A value tag in the item will overwrite the channel level tag and will be prioritized by most apps if a listener boosts the currently playing track. However, different apps may handle the display and experience of item vs channel level boosts differently, so it's important to test your splits in different apps. Common use cases of value tags include writing splits in the channel level for those who worked on the entire project and writing splits in the item level for people who may have been featured on or contributed to one or more specific tracks, but not on all of the tracks on the album. This might include a guest producer, an album artwork designer or a featured vocalist or musician.  -->
