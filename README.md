# Demu Feed Template
This repo is the home of all template files and instructional materials for Decentralized Music (Demu) publication.
Artists are encouraged to use these materials and template files to aid in the self-publishing process.
These materials are offered on a value-for-Value basis. If you receive value from any of the materials presented,
please consider returning that value to Spencer or the self-hosted Demu movement in the form of a contribution of
your time, talent or treasure. The easiest way is to leave the Value Split for "the Wolf" intact in the RSS feeds
you create using this template. Other ways include donations over Lightning to [sirspencer@getalby.com](https://getalby.com/p/sirspencer),
contributing to decentralized music projects and telling other artists about decentralized music.

Instructional demo videos to come!
